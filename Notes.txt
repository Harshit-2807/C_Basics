Difference b/w for and while loop:
for loop used for finite conditions but while can be used for both finite and infinite conditions

Loop acts in three parts: 1. Initialization   2. Condition   3. Increment/Decrement

Interview Question:
    for(int i=1;i<=5;i++);
        printf("Chitkara %d",i);
Output: Chitkara 6
Reason: there is semicolon after for statement so it concludes while reading internal part and after loop runs value written for loop run once.
